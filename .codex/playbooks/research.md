# Research / Discovery Playbook

1. Frame the question
   - Capture the unknowns, desired deliverables, and time-box; confirm the depth of analysis expected.
2. Gather context quickly
   - Search code, docs, and issues to locate prior art; note knowledge gaps and terminology definitions.
3. Explore systematically
   - Form hypotheses, test them with targeted experiments or trace reading, and log findings as you go.
   - Prefer lightweight scripts or REPL snippets over permanent code changes unless deliverables require it.
4. Synthesize insights
   - Distill raw findings into actionable guidance, options, or decision points.
   - Highlight data sources, reproducible commands, and any areas where confidence is low.
5. Recommend next moves
   - Offer clear suggestions (build proof-of-concept, schedule design review, collect metrics) to transition from research to execution.
