# Handoff Checklist

Use this before finalizing a response.

- [ ] Confirm all plan steps are complete or explicitly deferred; update the plan tool one last time if used.
- [ ] Ensure the feature's logic gate suite is defined, executed locally, and fully green; note any deferred checks.
- [ ] Ensure diffs are staged or listed; double-check for stray debug prints or commented code.
- [ ] Summarize validation evidence (tests, lint) and call out anything unrun or flaky.
- [ ] Prepare final answer with change explanation first, followed by file references and next steps.
- [ ] Mention open questions, risks, or follow-up tasks so the user can react quickly.
- [ ] Verify formatting: concise bullets, ASCII snippets, correct path anchors, and no raw command dumps.
