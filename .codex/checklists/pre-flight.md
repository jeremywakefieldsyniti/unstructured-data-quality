# Pre-flight Checklist

Use this before making changes.

- [ ] Re-read system, developer, and user instructions; note any repo-specific constraints.

- [ ] Inspect repo context (`ls`, `rg`, docs) to understand languages, tooling, and existing guidelines.
- [ ] Decide whether the planning tool is required; sketch the initial plan if so.
- [ ] Identify feature logic gates (automated suites, manual checks, documentation updates) to enforce before handoff.
- [ ] Identify validation strategy (tests, linters, manual checks) and required commands.
- [ ] Verify you know the desired deliverable format (code changes, review, analysis, etc.).
