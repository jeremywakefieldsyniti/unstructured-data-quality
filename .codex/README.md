# Codex Agent Playbook

This directory collects working agreements and reference material for running Codex as an agentic pair-programmer in this project.

## Quick start
- Review `.codex/best-practices.md` before starting multi-step work and capture the feature's logic gates up front.
- Skim the relevant checklist in `.codex/checklists` prior to editing files or handing off; mark the gate items as you execute them.
- Use the playbooks in `.codex/playbooks` when scoping features, bugfixes, or research tasksâ€”feature work must follow the gate-driven flow in `feature-development.md`.

## Directory layout
- `best-practices.md`: opinionated guidance distilled from modern Codex workflows.
- `checklists/`: short reminders to keep delivery consistent.
- `playbooks/`: step-by-step patterns for common task types.

Contributions to these docs should stay concise, actionable, and in plain ASCII. Keep examples up to date with the current repository tooling.
